# IoT-Firmware-Analysis-Halmstad-University-

This is a project for Halmstads University's course Ethical hacking.
Our project was to extract, inspect, and analyze a firmware image from a simulated IoT device to identify hardcoded secrets, debug interfaces, or insecure services.

The group decided to analyze the simulated firmware OWASP IoTGoat. This was analyzed with the help from Ubuntu and tools like binwalk, QEMU, strings, hexdump.

In this GitHub you will see our extraction logs, scripts used by us, findings of vulnerabilities, and update recommendations to make the firmware safer in theory.
There will also be a report where we show pictures of the live analyse and results we get from running our scripts. Go and read it for more results in this project.
