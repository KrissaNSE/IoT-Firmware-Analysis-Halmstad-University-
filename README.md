# IoT-Firmware-Analysis-Halmstad-University-

This is a project for Halmstads University's course Ethical hacking.
Our project was to extract, inspect, and analyze a firmware image from a simulated IoT device to identify hardcoded secrets, debug interfaces, or insecure services.

The group decided to analyze the simulated firmware OWASP IoTGoat. This was analyzed with the help from Ubuntu and tools like binwalk, QEMU, strings, hexdump.

In this GitHub you will see our extraction logs, scripts used by us, findings of vulnerabilities, and update recommendations to make the firmware safer in theory.
Go and read findings for more deeper results in this project. There will be pictures from our live analyze of the firmware image. You can also then see what we used our script for.
